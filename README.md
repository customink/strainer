# Strainer

Strainer is a gem for isolating and testing individual chef cookbooks. It allows you to keep all your cookbooks in a single repository (saving you time and money), while having all the benefits of individual repositories.

Usage
-----
Strainer is a command line tool. The first thing you should do is add the following entry into your `.gitignore` and `chefignore` files:

    .colander

The `.colander` directory is where strainer puts all your temporary files for testing. You should not commit it to source control, nor should you upload it if sharing this cookbook with the community.

Next, create a `Colanderfile`. Cookbook-level Colanderfiles will take precedence over root-level ones. For simplicity, let's just create one in the root of our chef repository:

    # Colanderfile
    knife test: bundle exec knife cookbook test $COOKBOOK
    foodcritic: bundle exec foodcritic -f any cookbooks/$COOKBOOK

`Colanderfile` exposes two variables:

- `$COOKBOOK` - the current running cookbook
- `$SANDBOX` - the sandbox path

Just like foreman, the labels don't actually matter - they are only used in formatting the output.

That `Colanderfile` will run [foodcritic](https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic) and knife test. I recommend this as the bare minimum for a cookbook test.

`Colanderfile`s commands are run in the context to the sandbox `.colander` directory. The sandbox is essentially a clone of your working directory. This can be a bit confusing. `knife cookbook test` requires that you run your command against the "root" directory, yet foodcrtitic and chefspec require you run inside an actual cookbook. Here's a quick example to clear up some confusion:

    # Colanderfile
    knife test: bundle exec knife cookbook test $COOKBOOK
    foodcritic: bundle exec foodcritic -f any $SANDBOX/$COOKBOOK
    chefspec: bundle exec rspec $SANDBOX/$COOKBOOK

To strain, simply run the `strain` command and pass in the cookbook(s) to strain:

    $ bundle exec strain phantomjs tmux

This will first detect the cookbook dependencies, copy the cookbook and all dependencies into a sandbox. It will execute the contents of the `Colanderfile` on each cookbook.

Using Berkshelf
---------------
[Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) is a tool for managing multiple cookbooks. It works very similar to how a `Gemfile` works with Rubygems.

You'll need to tell Berkshelf to install the cookbooks to a folder inside your local repository. This way, strainer can actually find them.

For example, this will install your cookbooks into the `berks-cookbooks` directory:

    $ bundle exec berks install --path berks-cookbooks

Finally, make sure that this path is **first** in your `.chef/knife.rb` file:

```ruby
# .chef/knife.rb
current_dir = File.dirname(__FILE__)
cookbook_path ["#{current_dir}/../berks-cookbooks", "#{current_dir}/../cookbooks"]
```

Or pass it as an argument to the `strain` command:

    $ bundle exec strain phantomjs --cookbooks-path berks-cookbooks

Failing Quickly
---------------
As of `v0.0.4`, there's an option for `--fail-fast` that will fail immediately when any strain command returns a non-zero exit code:

    $ bundle exec strain phantomjs --fail-fast

This can save time, especially when running tests locally. This is *not* recommended on continuous integration.

Custom Foodcritic Rules
-----------------------
I always advocate using both [Etsy Foodcritic Rules](https://github.com/etsy/foodcritic-rules) and [CustomInk Foodcritic Rules](https://github.com/customink-webops/foodcritic-rules) in all your projects. I also advocate keeping them all as submodules in `[Chef Repo]/foodcritic/...`. This makes strainer unhappy...

Strainer runs everything in an isolated sandbox, inside your Chef Repo. When including additional foodcritic rules, you need to do something like this:

    # Colanderfile
    foodcritic: bundle exec foodcritic -I foodcritic/* -f any $SANDBOX/$COOKBOOK
